## How to Use Savepoints

When you need to revert to a specific working state of the application:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# List all branches
git branch -a

# Checkout a specific savepoint
git checkout dual-deploy-3-sp1  # For the latest working state with file uploads

# Or checkout an earlier savepoint if needed
git checkout dual-deploy-1-sp1  # For the basic working deployment
```

## Deployment Configuration

### Frontend (Static Site)
- **Root Directory**: `client`
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `VITE_API_URL`: URL of your backend API

### Backend (Web Service)
- **Root Directory**: `server`
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm install --no-save @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-typescript && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy && npx babel src --out-dir dist --extensions ".ts" --presets=@babel/preset-typescript,@babel/preset-env`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `PORT`: 4100
  - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
  - `JWT_SECRET`: 2322
  - `FRONTEND_URL`: URL of your frontend
  - `NODE_ENV`: production

### Render Disk (for file uploads)
- **Name**: `uploads-disk`
- **Mount Path**: `/opt/render/project/src/server/uploads`
- **Size**: 1 GB (or as needed)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after deploying a savepoint:

1. **Check Logs**: Review the Render logs for both frontend and backend services
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
3. **Test Endpoints**: Use the diagnostic endpoints to verify functionality:
   - `/api/ping`: Verifies API connectivity
   - `/api/db-check`: Verifies database connection
   - `/api/test-disk`: Verifies disk access and file creation
4. **Check Disk Configuration**: Ensure the Render Disk is properly configured and mounted

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for future savepoints:

1. **Cloud Storage Integration**: Add option to use cloud storage services like Cloudinary
2. **Image Optimization**: Add automatic image resizing and optimization
3. **File Cleanup**: Implement automatic cleanup of old or unused files
4. **Multi-region Deployment**: Configure for multi-region deployment
5. **CDN Integration**: Add CDN for faster static asset delivery
